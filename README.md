The main target of this project is creating an indoor navigation for Bilkent University buildings. Currently, navigation option contains only one building in Bilkent University.
 This applicaiton also includes extra 5 features that can ease campus life. All features work smootly. <br/>  <br/>
 **0.** Indoor Navigation. <br/>
 **1.** Find closest vending machine. <br/>

 **3.** Ring schedule. <br/>
 **4.** Markets and Cafeterias in Bilkent university with working hours and phone numbers. <br/>
 **5.** Map that shows the places where smoking is allowed in main campus.  <br/>

 
 # Features that can be improved
 The current version of this project works by communicating with user to detect the instant location of the user. However, it is possible to change it with a different positioning that can detect 
 current floor and position of the user. We used sensors to find the current floor and GPS to find the location. It worked smootly. Some code blocks that can be used for this purpose can be found in 
 repository. However, this part should be developped so it is not included to the current version.
