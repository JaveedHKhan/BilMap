 # Features that can be improved
 The current version of this project works by communicating with user to detect the instant location of the user. However, it is possible to change it with an different positioning that can detect 
 current floor and position of the user. We used sensors to find the current floor and GPS to find the location. It worked smootly. Some code blocks that can be used for this purpose can be found in 
 repository. However, this part should be developped so it is not included to the current version.
